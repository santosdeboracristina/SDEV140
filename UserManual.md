# SDEV140 - FINAL PROJECT

Hi there, welcome to My Exchange Rate App :)

### Libraries you will need:
* tkinter (usually comes with your Python already) but you will need to import it;
* requests: `pip install requests`

For the images to be displayed, you will need to have the files in the same folder as your exchange_rate.py
You don't have to worry about that if you download the whole folder I put together for ya! 

Run the main file (exchange_rate.py) and the main window will pop up
two buttons will be displayed: 
1. Get Exchange Rates: will get the updated exchange rates for dolar, euro and bitcoin;
2. Close: Will close the window and end the application.

⚠️ Disclaimer: Brazilian Reais are considered when getting the rates from the API.
With that said, it means that, 1 brazilian real equals xyz amount of dollars, euros and bitcoins.
